**Key Changes:**

* **Consistent Heading Levels:** Used `#` for the main title, `##` for sections (Features, Technologies, Getting Started, etc.), and avoided nested headings within sections.
* **Improved Formatting:** 
    * Removed unnecessary indentation and line breaks.
    * Used consistent spacing and bullet points for better readability.
    * Corrected the `Bash` code block to be consistent with other code blocks.
* **Removed Unnecessary Elements:** Removed the `###` headings within the `## Features` section as they were redundant.

This improved README file is more concise, easier to read, and adheres to standard Markdown conventions.
